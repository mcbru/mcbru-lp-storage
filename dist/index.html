      <h2>A history of helping storage vendors reach their goals.</h2>
      <p>Over our 23-year history, McBru has developed a depth and breadth of expertise in the storage and network services industry that’s hard to match. During that time, we’ve worked with a number of leading storage, cloud and network services companies: start-ups and market leaders, hardware-centric and software-only, on-premises and hybrid-cloud, to tell their story, build their brand and fill their funnel.</p>
      <p>Below is a sampling of current and past clients who have chosen McBru’s Brand Development, Brand Narrative and/or Brand Demand <a href="http://www.mcbru.com/services/">services</a> to boost awareness, drive revenue and establish a uniquely strong market position in these markets:</p>

With its business now in order, Isilon was ready to relaunch. McBru supplied the missing ingredients with a launch strategy and all-new positioning and messaging framework that put Isilon back in front of the market with a consistently positive, forward-looking story of innovation and scale-out storage category leadership. McBru’s integrated media relations and social media marketing did the heavy lifting for Isilon’s outbound marketing as the company’s share price climbed from under $2 to a buyout by EMC Corp. for more than $33/share.</p>

              <p>Network services provider Integra engaged McBru at an inflection point in the brand’s storied history. One of the few regional CLECs born of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to survive and thrive through the dot-com era, Integra had built its business on services and support tailored to SMBs. With that market under threat by lower-cost cable providers, Integra sought to leverage its considerable fiberoptic assets to support an organizational shift toward enterprise customers as its core focus.</p>
              <p>Integra chose McBru and its brand development and brand narrative programs to set the strategy for a new brand identity that reflected the company’s evolution and its new, sophisticated marketplace and audiences. With a blend of PR, social media and content strategy, McBru executed the vast communications effort to deliver the messages behind the company’s new brand to the audiences that needed to hear it, successfully positioning the company squarely in front of the enterprise buyers and influencers who were looking for a nimble, asset-rich alternative to pricey, inflexible incumbent carriers.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Led strategy and execution for relaunch of corporate brand, earning extensive coverage and cementing perception of brand as enterprise-focused</li>
